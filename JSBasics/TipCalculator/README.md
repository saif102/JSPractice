Tip Calculator
**********************************

    Johan and his family went on a holiday and went to three different
    restaurents. The bills were €124, €48 and €268.

    To tip the waiter a fair amount, Johan created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill
    when the bill is less than €50, 15% when the bill is between
    €50 and €200, and 10% when the bill is more than ¢200.

    In the end, Johan would like to have two arrays:
    1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
    2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

    NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply if with
    20/100 = 0.2
