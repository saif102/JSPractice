Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index),
which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height).
(mass in kg and height in meter).

1) For each of them, creat an object with properties for their
full name, mass and height.

02) Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI, 
together with the full name and the respective BMI. 

Don't forget they might have the same BMI.
